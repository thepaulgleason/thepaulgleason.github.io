Overview: 
focusTomato is a timer application that tracks what a user has worked on. 
The goal of the app is to clearly keep track of the amount of time the user has worked on a project 
while also letting the user know while he is working if he should keep working, stop, or take a break.
The app is inspired by the pomodoro techniue where users work using deliberate pratice focused attention for 25 minutes and then takes a 5 minute break.

The app will be offered as a native mobile app, on the web, and on a smart watch.
Front end is swift for mobile and javascript/html for web.
The backend will be firebase by google. 
The web is hosted on github for now, firebase hosts the backend database.

Conext:
This app is necesarry so users can track their own data no matter what the task is (exercise, meditation, working, reading) 
There are no free software out there that tracks tasks and serves as a timer.
The pomodoro technique, the intervals for workouts, the bells for meditation all in one place is not offered in any other app (that we know of).
The app also represents me, it is part of my (Paul's) brand.
It is a personal app that my friends can use as well (hence why noSql and simple html html pages are used, they are easy to set up and not intended for scale).

Goals:
A. users will be more productive
B. Users feel a greater sense of purpose by knowing how productive they have been
C. Users Time Well Spent increases (the app is not disctracting, but increases their focus on the task at hand).
D. Daily sessions per daily active users is 2  (# of daily sessions)/(# of daily active users)
E. I will not be deploying this into the mass market (at least this version of the app.
