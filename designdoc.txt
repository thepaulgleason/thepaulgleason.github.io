Deisgn Doc for FocusTomato (feasability analysis)
Project: focusTomato  
People: Paul Gleason
template for design doc: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-write-a-good-software-design-document-66fcf019569c

Overview: 
focusTomato is a timer application that tracks what a user has worked on. 
The goal of the app is to clearly keep track of the amount of time the user has worked on a project 
while also letting the user know while he is working if he should keep working, stop, or take a break.
The app is inspired by the pomodoro techniue where users work using deliberate pratice focused attention for 25 minutes and then takes a 5 minute break.

The app will be offered as a native mobile app, on the web, and on a smart watch.
Front end is swift for mobile and javascript/html for web.
The backend will be firebase by google. 
The web is hosted on github for now, firebase hosts the backend database.

Conext:
This app is necesarry so users can track their own data no matter what the task is (exercise, meditation, working, reading) 
There are no free software out there that tracks tasks and serves as a timer.
The pomodoro technique, the intervals for workouts, the bells for meditation all in one place is not offered in any other app (that we know of).
The app also represents me, it is part of my (Paul's) brand.
It is a personal app that my friends can use as well (hence why noSql and simple html html pages are used, they are easy to set up and not intended for scale).

Goals:
A. users will be more productive
B. Users feel a greater sense of purpose by knowing how productive they have been
C. Users Time Well Spent increases (the app is not disctracting, but increases their focus on the task at hand).
D. Daily sessions per daily active users is 2  (# of daily sessions)/(# of daily active users)
E. I will not be deploying this into the mass market (at least this version of the app. 
If there is a need for the 

Milestones:
1. create a web page
	-add firebase authentication
	-add timer functionality
	-add tasks
	-add database
	-add task buttons and show data for each task
2. create an ios app
	-add firebase authentication
	-add timer functionality
	-add tasks
	-add database
	-add task buttons and show data for each task
3. create the watch app
4. allow user to download data so they can import it to excel or google sheets

Existing Solution

Should i use firebase or use sql
firebase
-it comes with authentication
-it has noSql so if i don't want to scale
- not sure if i can convert the data to excel sheet if i wanted to edit the data
-comes with hosting
-not sure if i will ever use it on a job, wont look as good as sql (assumption, let me look this one up)


sql
-many companies use sql and it would be good to add to my resume
-it would be something i could use in the future
-it would be free just like firebase
-i could use it if this app scales (more users, more features added)
-relational
-i would learn a lot more (i think)

-more complicated to set up
-not sure if it the project really needs it
-more difficult to do to update the database (especially in realtime)
